## Academic Background

- Master’s Degree in Computer Science (specialization: Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision) – Final Year
- Bachelor’s Degree in Mathematics and Computer Science

### Key Academic Projects

- **From-scratch Image Classifier (Pandas, Cats, Dogs)**  
  Implemented a CNN architecture without any pre-trained backbone as part of OpenCV University training.

- **Somali Food Classification**  
  Fine-tuned pre-trained models on a culturally specific dataset using transfer learning techniques.

- **Landscape Segmentation (Challenge Entry)**  
  Implemented and trained segmentation models on outdoor scenes, focusing on model tuning and validation metrics.

### Key Personal Projects

- [Leaf Classification with Vision Transformer (ViT) + MobileNetV3][link]
